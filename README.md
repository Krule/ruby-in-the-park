Ruby in-the-Park
================

## Let's have a picnic!
- Because the weather is nice.
- Because you are awesome.
- Because parks are awesome.

### When?
The next picnic is going to be in "Park am Glesidreick" on Sunday the 6th of July.

The discussion is going on in [issue #7](https://github.com/ruby-in-the-park/ruby-in-the-park/issues/7).

### Where?
Any park in Berlin.

We've had picnics in:

- [x] Tempelhofer Feld
- [ ] Park am Glesidreick

### Previous Picnics

- [June 1st](https://github.com/ruby-in-the-park/ruby-in-the-park/issues/4)

## The Rules
- Respect is a priority. Fun as well.
- Vegetarians and non vegetarians are equally welcome. Same goes for beer, favourite ruby framework and Scala or Java.
- [insert your rule/request here as a PR]

## The why
I like the ruby community and I like parks. I have no idea about picnic organising so I'm hoping social coding can give me a hand.

Ruby in-the-Park
================

### Let's have a picnic!
- Because the weather is nice.
- Because you are awesome.
- Because parks are awesome.

## The Idea
The idea is simple: gather people together in a park some weekend, have a picnic and share. 

The first thing to agree on: Is anyone interested? What date works for you? Please comment in [Issue #1](https://github.com/ruby-in-the-park/ruby-in-the-park/issues/1).

## The Rules
- Respect is a priority.
- Vegetarians and non vegetarians are equally welcome. Same goes for beer, favourite ruby framework and Scala or Java.
- [insert your rule/request here as a PR]

## Where?
Somewhere in Berlin

## The why
I like the ruby community and I like parks. I have no idea on how to organized something so I'm hoping social coding can give me a hand.

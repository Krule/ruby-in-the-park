Ruby in-the-Park
================

### Let's have a picnic!
- Because the weather is nice.
- Because you are awesome.
- Because parks are awesome.

## The Idea
The idea is simple: gather people together in a park some weekend, have a picnic and share.

## When?
As [discussed](https://github.com/ruby-in-the-park/ruby-in-the-park/issues/2), it's going to be on the **1st of June**. 

There's an [iCal file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruby-in-the-park/ruby-in-the-park/master/ical.ics?87eddf7be877d2e72b67dc3d938008e48b3d241e) (right click and save-as ``something.ics`` will do the job) so you can remember it.


## Where?
Tempelhofer Feld, Berlin.
The exact location will be updated soon.

## The Rules
- Respect is a priority. Fun as well.
- Vegetarians and non vegetarians are equally welcome. Same goes for beer, favourite ruby framework and Scala or Java.
- [insert your rule/request here as a PR]

## The why
I like the ruby community and I like parks. I have no idea on how to organized something so I'm hoping social coding can give me a hand.
